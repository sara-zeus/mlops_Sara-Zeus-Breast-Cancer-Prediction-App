## Objective
This repository hosts the code for a specialized Breast Cancer Prediction App tailored for cytology labs. By harnessing machine learning techniques and utilizing the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), my project aims to develop a predictive tool for identifying breast tumor malignancy. 
 - :reminder_ribbon: [App Link](https://sara-zeus-breast-cancer-prediction-app.streamlit.app)
- Specifically designed for lab technicians, the app interprets cellular morphological features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples.

## Functionality
- **Data Input:** Users have the flexibility to input data manually or connect their devices for a streamlined analysis.
- **Visualization:** The app provides a radar chart illustrating critical cellular characteristics.
- **Prediction:** It offers predictions regarding tumor classification as benign or malignant.

## Features
Derived from digitized images of FNA samples from breast masses, the app's analysis centers on Cellular Morphological Features. It serves as a valuable tool for laboratory technicians, aiding in the prediction of breast cancer based on tissue samples.

## Dataset
The underlying machine learning model is trained on the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), enhancing accuracy and reliability.
